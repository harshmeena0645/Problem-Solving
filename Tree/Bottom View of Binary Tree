Bottom View of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return an array where elements represent the bottom view of the binary tree from left to right.

Note: If there are multiple bottom-most nodes for a horizontal distance from the root, then the later one in the level order traversal is considered. For example, in the below diagram, 7 and 34 both are the bottommost nodes at a horizontal distance of 0 from the root, here 34 will be considered.

For the above tree, the output should be 5 8 34 22 25

Examples :

Input: root[] = [1, 3, 2]

Output: [3 1 2]
Explanation: First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.

Thus bottom view of the binary tree will be 3 1 2.
Input: root[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]
         
Output: [40 20 60 30]

        # Return values in order from leftmost to rightmost
        return [hd_node[hd] for hd in range(min_hd, max_hd + 1)]
