Diagonal Tree Traversal

Given a Binary Tree, return the diagonal traversal of the binary tree.

Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes. Given a Binary Tree, return a single list containing all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.
If the diagonal element are present in two different subtrees then left subtree diagonal element should be taken first and then right subtree. 

Examples :

Input : root = [8, 3, 10, 1, 6, N, 14, N, N, 4, 7, 13]
            8
         /     \
        3      10
      /   \      \
     1     6     14
         /   \   /
        4     7 13
Output : [8, 10, 14, 3, 6, 7, 13, 1, 4]

Input: root = [1, 2, N, 3, N]
                1
               /
