Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:


Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.


class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.max_sum = float('-inf')
        self.dfs(root)
        return self.max_sum
    
    def dfs(self, node):
        if not node: return 0
        
        # only add positive contributions
        leftST_sum = max(0, self.dfs(node.left))
        rightST_sum = max(0, self.dfs(node.right))

        # check if cumulative sum at current node > global max sum so far
        # this evaluates a candidate path
        self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, leftST_sum + rightST_sum + node.val)
        
        # add to the current node ONLY one of the children contributions
        # in order to maintain the constraint of considering only paths
        # if not, we would be exploring explore the whole tree - against problem definition
        return max(leftST_sum, rightST_sum) + node.val
