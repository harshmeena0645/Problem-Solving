Predecessor and Successor

You are given root node of the BST and an integer key. You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of the given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.

Note:- In an inorder traversal the number just smaller than the target is the predecessor and the number just greater than the target is the successor. 

Input: root[] = [8, 1, 9, N, 4, N, 10, 3, N, N, N], key = 8

Output: 4 9
Explanation: In the given BST the inorder predecessor of 8 is 4 and inorder successor of 8 is 9.

Input: root[] = [10, 2, 11, 1, 5, N, N, N, N, 3, 6, N, 4, N, N], key = 11
Output: 10 -1
Explanation: In given BST, the inorder predecessor of 11 is 10 whereas it does not have any inorder successor.

Input: root[] = [2, 1, 3], key = 3
Output: 2 -1
Explanation: In given BST, the inorder predecessor of 3 is 2 whereas it does not have any inorder successor.

                    while tmp.left:
                        tmp = tmp.left
                    self.suc = tmp

            elif key < node.data:
                self.suc = node
                helper(node.left)
            else:
                self.pre = node
                helper(node.right)

        helper(root)
        return (self.pre, self.suc)
