Merge Two Balanced Binary Search Trees

You are given two balanced binary search trees e.g., AVL or Red-Black Tree. Write a function that merges the two given balanced BSTs into a balanced binary search tree. Let there be m elements in the first tree and n elements in the other tree. Your merge function should take O(m+n) time.
In the following solutions, it is assumed that the sizes of trees are also given as input. If the size is not given, then we can get the size by traversing the tree (See this).

Method 1 (Insert elements of the first tree to the second):
Take all elements of the first BST one by one, and insert them into the second BST. Inserting an element to a self-balancing BST takes Logn time (See this) where n is the size of the BST. So time complexity of this method is Log(n) + Log(n+1) ... Log(m+n-1). The value of this expression will be between mLogn and mLog(m+n-1). As an optimization, we can pick the smaller tree as the first tree.

Method 2 (Merge Inorder Traversals):
Do inorder traversal of the first tree and store the traversal in one temp array arr1[]. This step takes O(m) time. 
Do inorder traversal of the second tree and store the traversal in another temp array arr2[]. This step takes O(n) time. 
The arrays created in steps 1 and 2 are sorted arrays. Merge the two sorted arrays into one array of size m + n. This step takes O(m+n) time. 
Construct a balanced tree from the merged array using the technique discussed in this post. This step takes O(m+n) time.
