Leaves at Same Level or Not

determine whether all the leaf nodes are at the same level or not. Return true if all leaf nodes are at the same level, and false otherwise.

Input: root = [1, 2, 3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: true
Explanation: The binary tree has a height of 2 and the leaves are at the same level.

Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 10, 15, N, N]
Output: false
Explanation: The binary tree has a height of 3 and the leaves are not at the same level.

Input: root = [3, 2, 1]
Output: true
