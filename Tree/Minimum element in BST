Minimum element in BST

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree. The task is to find the minimum valued element in this given BST.

Input: root = [5, 4, 6, 3, N, N, 7, 1]
Output: 1

Input: root = [10, 5, 20, 2]
Output: 2

Input: root = [10, N, 10, N, 11]
             10
              \
               10
                \
                 11
Output: 10



class Solution:
    def minValue(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return -1
        current = root
        while current.left:
            current = current.left
        return current.data
