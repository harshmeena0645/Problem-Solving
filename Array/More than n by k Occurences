More than n/k Occurrences


Input: arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.

Input: arr = [2, 3, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2.

Input: arr = [1, 4, 7, 7], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: In the given array, no element appears more than n/k times.


class Solution:
    #Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
    def countOccurence(self,arr, k):
        n=len(arr)
        threshold=n//k
        freq={}
            
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
            
        count = 0
        for value in freq.values():
            if value > threshold:
                count += 1
    
        return count
