Sum of length

Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 39.49%Submissions: 4K+Points: 2Given an array arr. Calculate the sum of lengths of contiguous subarrays having all distinct elements.
Note: Return the answer with modulo 109+7.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 10
Explanation: [1, 2, 3] is a subarray of length 3 with distinct elements. [1, 2], [2, 3] are 2 subarray of length 2 with distinct elements. Total length of lengths two = 2 + 2 = 4  3 subarrays of length 1 with distinct element. Sum of lengths = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only subarray with distinct elements of length 1.  
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


class Solution:
    def sumoflength(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        seen = set()
        start = 0
        result = 0

        for end in range(n):
            while arr[end] in seen:
                seen.remove(arr[start])
                start += 1

            seen.add(arr[end])
            result += (end - start + 1)
            result %= MOD

        return result
