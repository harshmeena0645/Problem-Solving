Print all the duplicate characters in a string

Given a string S, the task is to print all the duplicate characters with their occurrences in the given string.

Example:

Input: S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output:
e, count = 4
g, count = 2
k, count = 2
s, count = 2

Explanation: g occurs 2 times in the string, k occurs 2 times in the string, s occurs 2 times in the string while e occurs 4 times in the string rest of the characters have unique occurrences.


def printDuplicates(str):
    # Converting string to list of characters
    char_list = list(str)
    # Sorting the list of characters
    char_list.sort()
    
    # Loop through the sorted list to find duplicates
    i = 0
    while i < len(char_list):
        count = 1
        # Counting the occurrences of each character
        while i < len(char_list)-1 and char_list[i] == char_list[i+1]:
            count += 1
            i += 1
        
        # Printing the duplicate character and its count
        if count > 1:
            print(char_list[i], ", count = ", count)
        i += 1

str = "test string"
printDuplicates(str)


Output
s, count = 2
t, count = 3
Time Complexity: O(N*logN), where n is the length of the string 
Auxiliary Space: O(1), if you observe we did not use any extra space.
