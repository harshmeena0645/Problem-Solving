Boyer Moore Algorithm for Pattern Searching

Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in a notepad/word file, browser, or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.

A typical problem statement would be- 

" Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1] where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern, write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m. "
Examples: 

Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
           pat[] = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10

Input:  txt[] =  "AABAACAADAABAABA"
           pat[] =  "AABA"
Output: Pattern found at index 0
              Pattern found at index 9
             Pattern found at index 12



NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def badCharHeuristic(pat):
    badChar = [-1] * NO_OF_CHARS
    for i in range(len(pat)):
        badChar[ord(pat[i])] = i
    return badChar

def search(txt, pat):
    m = len(pat)
    n = len(txt)
    badChar = badCharHeuristic(pat)

    s = 0  # shift of the pattern
    while s <= n - m:
        j = m - 1

        while j >= 0 and pat[j] == txt[s + j]:
            j -= 1

        if j < 0:
            print("Pattern found at index", s)
            s += m - badChar[ord(txt[s + m])] if s + m < n else 1
        else:
            s += max(1, j - badChar[ord(txt[s + j])])

# Example usage:
search("ABAAABCD", "ABC")


🕒 Time Complexity:
Best case: O(n/m)
Worst case: O(mn), but in practice it performs much better than naive search.
