Remove Nth Node From End of List

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]


class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        fast, slow = head, head
        for _ in range(n): fast = fast.next
        if not fast: return head.next
        while fast.next: fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
