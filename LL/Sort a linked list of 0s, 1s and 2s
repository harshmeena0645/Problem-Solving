Sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s

Given a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s, The task is to sort the list in non-decreasing order.

Examples: 

Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> NULL
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> NULL

Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
Output: 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> NULL 

[Expected Approach - 1] By Maintaining Frequency - O(n) Time and O(1) Space:
The idea is to traverse the linked List and count the number of nodes having values 0, 1 and 2 and store them in an array of size 3, say cnt[] such that

cnt[0] = count of nodes with value 0
cnt[1] = count of nodes with value 1 
cnt[2] = count of nodes with value 2
Now, traverse the linked list again to fill the first cnt[0] nodes with 0, then next cnt[1] nodes with 1 and finally cnt[2] nodes with 2.



# Python Program to sort a linked list of 0s, 1s or 2s

class Node:
    def __init__(self, new_data):
        self.data = new_data
        self.next = None

# Function to sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s
def sort_list(head):
  
    # Initialize count of '0', '1' and '2' as 0
    cnt = [0, 0, 0]
    ptr = head

    # Traverse and count total number of '0', '1' and '2'
    # cnt[0] will store total number of '0's
    # cnt[1] will store total number of '1's
    # cnt[2] will store total number of '2's
    while ptr is not None:
        cnt[ptr.data] += 1
        ptr = ptr.next

    idx = 0
    ptr = head

    # Fill first cnt[0] nodes with value 0
    # Fill next cnt[1] nodes with value 1
    # Fill remaining cnt[2] nodes with value 2
    while ptr is not None:
        if cnt[idx] == 0:
            idx += 1
        else:
            ptr.data = idx
            cnt[idx] -= 1
            ptr = ptr.next

def print_list(node):
    while node is not None:
        print(f" {node.data}", end='')
        node = node.next
    print("\n")


if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Create a hard-coded linked list:
    # 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
    head = Node(1)
    head.next = Node(1)
    head.next.next = Node(2)
    head.next.next.next = Node(1)
    head.next.next.next.next = Node(0)

    print("Linked List before Sorting:", end='')
    print_list(head)
    
    sort_list(head)

    print("Linked List after Sorting:", end='')
    print_list(head)      




Output
Linked List before Sorting: 1 1 2 1 0
Linked List after Sorting: 0 1 1 1 2
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
