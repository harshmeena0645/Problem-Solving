Number of Triangles in Directed and Undirected Graphs

Given a Graph, count number of triangles in it. The graph is can be directed or undirected.

Example: 

Input: digraph[V][V] = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
                        {1, 0, 0, 1},
                        {0, 1, 0, 0},
                        {0, 0, 1, 0}
                      };
Output: 2
Give adjacency matrix represents following 
directed graph.

                # check the triplet 
                # if it satisfies the condition
                if(i != j and i != k
                   and j != k and
                   g[i][j] and g[j][k] 
                   and g[k][i]):
                    count_Triangle += 1
    
    # If graph is directed , division is done by 3
    # else division by 6 is done
    if isDirected:
      return count_Triangle//3  
    else: return count_Triangle//6


# Create adjacency matrix of an undirected graph

         [1, 0, 1, 1],

           [0, 1, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 1, 0]]

print("The Number of triangles in undirected graph : %d" %
      countTriangle(graph, False))

print("The Number of triangles in directed graph : %d" %
      countTriangle(digraph, True))
