Hamiltonian Path

Undirected graph with n vertices and m edges
Hamiltonian path -> In undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once.

n: The number of vertices in the graph.
m: The number of edges in the graph.
edges[][]: A 2D list where each element edges[i] represents an edge between two vertices edges[i][0] and edges[i][1]. 

n = 4, m = 4 
edges[][]= { {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {2,4} }
Output: 1 
Explanation: There is a hamiltonian path: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 

n = 4, m = 3 
edges[][] = { {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4} } 
Output: 0 
Explanation: It can be proved that there is no hamiltonian path in the given graph.

            for nei in graph[node]:
                if not (visited & (1 << (nei - 1))):

                        return True
            return False

        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            visited = 1 << (start - 1)
            if dfs(start, visited, 1):
                return 1

        return 0
