Tug of War

Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to divide it into two subsets such that the absolute difference between the sum of elements in the two subsets.

If n is even, both subsets must have exactly n/2 elements.
If n is odd, one subset must have (nâˆ’1)/2 elements and the other must have (n+1)/2 elements.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 5, -3, 100, 1, 89, 54, 23, 20]
Output: 
3 5 -3 89 54 
4 100 1 23 20 
Explanation: The absolute difference between the two subsets is 0.

Input: arr[] = [23, 45, -34, 12, 0, 98, -99, 4, 189, -1, 4]
Output: 
23 0 -99 4 189 4 
45 -34 12 98 -1 
Explanation: The absolute difference between the two subsets is 1, which is minimum.
