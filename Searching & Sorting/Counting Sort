Counting Sort

Given a string arr consisting of lowercase english letters, arrange all its letters in lexicographical order using Counting Sort.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
S = "edsab"
Output:
abdes
Explanation: 
In lexicographical order, string will be 
abdes.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 13
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output:
eeeefggkkorss
Explanation:
In lexicographical order, string will be 
eeeefggkkorss.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function countSort() that takes string arr as a parameter and returns the sorted string. The printing is done by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).       


class Solution:
    def countSort(self, arr):
        freq = [0] * 26
        
        for ch in arr:
            freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

        result = []
        for i in range(26):
            result.append(chr(i + ord('a')) * freq[i])
        
        return ''.join(result)
