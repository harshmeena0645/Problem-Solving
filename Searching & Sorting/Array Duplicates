Array Duplicates

Given an array arr of integers, find all the elements that occur more than once in the array. If no element repeats, return an empty array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Input: arr[] = [0, 3, 1, 2] 
Output: [] 
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.
Input: arr[] = [2]
Output: [] 
Explanation: There is single element in the array. Therefore output is empty.



class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, arr):
        freq = {}
        res = []

        for num in arr:
            if num in freq:
                if freq[num] == 1:
                    res.append(num)
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1

        return sorted(res)
