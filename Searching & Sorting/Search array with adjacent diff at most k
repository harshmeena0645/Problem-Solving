Search array with adjacent diff at most k

Given a step array arr[], its step value k, and a key x, we need to find the index of key x in the array arr[]. If multiple occurrences of key x exist, return the first occurrence of the key. In case of no occurrence of key x exists return -1.

Note: A step array is an array of integers where the difference between adjacent elements is at most k. For example: arr[] = [4, 6, 7, 9] and k = 2 is a step array as the difference between the adjacent elements in the arr[] is at most 2.  

Examples

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 6, 7, 6] , k = 1 , x = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: In an array arr 6 is present at index 2. So, return 2.
Input: arr[] = [20, 40, 50], k = 20 , x = 70
Output: -1 
Explaination: As there is no occurrence of 70. So, return -1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


class Solution:
    def findStepKeyIndex(self, arr, k, x):
        i = 0
        n = len(arr)
        
        while i < n:
            if arr[i] == x:
                return i
            # Jump the steps smartly
            i += max(1, abs(arr[i] - x) // k)
        
        return -1
