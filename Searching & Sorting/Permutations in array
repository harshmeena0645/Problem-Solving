Permutations in array

ermute two arrays such that sum of every pair is greater or equal to K
Given two arrays of equal size n and an integer k. The task is to permute both arrays such that sum of their corresponding element is greater than or equal to k i.e a[i] + b[i] >= k. The task is to print "Yes" if any such permutation exists, otherwise print "No".
Given two arrays arr1[], arr2[], and an integer k. The task is to check if after permuting both arrays in such a way, we get the sum of their corresponding element greater than or equal to k i.e. arr1i + arr2i >= k for all i (from 0 to n-1). Return true if possible, else false. 

Examples : 

Input : a[] = {2, 1, 3}, 
        b[] = { 7, 8, 9 }, 
        k = 10. 
Output : Yes
Permutation  a[] = { 1, 2, 3 } and b[] = { 9, 8, 7 } 
satisfied the condition a[i] + b[i] >= K.

Input : a[] = {1, 2, 2, 1}, 
        b[] = { 3, 3, 3, 4 }, 
        k = 5. 
Output : No


def isPossible(a, b, n, k):
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b.sort()
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i] + b[i] < k):
            return False

    return True

if(isPossible(a, b, n, k)):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
