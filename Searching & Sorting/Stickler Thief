Stickler Thief

Thief cannot loot two consecutive houses.
Determine maximum amount he can loot.

arr[] = [6, 5, 5, 7, 4]
Output: 15
Explanation: Maximum amount he can get by looting 1st, 3rd and 5th house. Which is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

arr[] = [1, 5, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: Loot only 2nd house and get maximum amount of 5.

arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: 8
Explanation: The optimal choice is to loot every alternate house. Looting the 1st and 3rd houses, or the 2nd and 4th, both give a maximum total of 4 + 4 = 8.



class Solution:  
    def findMaxSum(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return arr[0]
        if n == 2:
            return max(arr[0], arr[1])

        prev2 = arr[0]  
        prev1 = max(arr[0], arr[1]) 

        for i in range(2, n):
            curr = max(prev1, prev2 + arr[i])
            prev2 = prev1
            prev1 = curr

        return prev1
