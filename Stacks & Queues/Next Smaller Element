Next Smaller Element

Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The NSE for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in the array. For elements for which no smaller element exists (on the right side), then consider NSE as -1. 

Examples:

Input: [4, 8, 5, 2, 25]
Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1]
Explanation: 
The first element smaller than 4 having index > 0 is 2.
The first element smaller than 8 having index > 1 is 5.
The first element smaller than 5 having index > 2 is 2.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 3.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 4.

Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]
Output: [7, 6, -1, -1]
Explanation: 
The first element smaller than 13 having index > 0 is 7.
The first element smaller than 7 having index > 1 is 6.
There are no elements smaller than 6 having index > 2.
There are no elements smaller than 12 having index > 3.

# Function to print element and NSE pair for all elements of list
def printNSE(arr):

    for i in range(0, len(arr), 1):

        next = -1
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr), 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                next = arr[j]
                break
            
        print(str(arr[i]) + " -- " + str(next))

# Driver program to test above function
arr = [11, 13, 21, 3]
printNSE(arr)

Output
11 --> 3
13 --> 3
21 --> 3
3 --> -1
Time Complexity: O(N^2) where N is the size of the input array.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
