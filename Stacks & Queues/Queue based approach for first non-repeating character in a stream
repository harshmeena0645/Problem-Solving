Queue based approach for first non-repeating character in a stream

Given a stream of characters and we have to find first non repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream. 

Examples: 

Input  : a a b c
Output : a -1 b b

Input  : a a c
Output : a -1 c


# Python3 program for a Queue based approach 
# to find first non-repeating character 
from queue import Queue 

# function to find first non 
# repeating character of sa Stream 
def firstnonrepeating(Str):
    global MAX_CHAR
    q = Queue()
    charCount = [0] * MAX_CHAR 
    
    # traverse whole Stream
    for i in range(len(Str)):

        # push each character in queue 
        q.put(Str[i]) 

        # increment the frequency count 
        charCount[ord(Str[i]) - 
                  ord('a')] += 1

        # check for the non repeating
        # character 
        while (not q.empty()): 
            if (charCount[ord(q.queue[0]) - 
                          ord('a')] > 1): 
                q.get() 
            else:
                print(q.queue[0], end = " ") 
                break

        if (q.empty()): 
            print(-1, end = " ")
    print()

MAX_CHAR = 26
