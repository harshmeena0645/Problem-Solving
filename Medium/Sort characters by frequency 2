Sort characters by frequency 2


Input: tree
Output: eert

Input: Aabb
Output: bbAa

Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


def frequencySort(s):
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in freq:
            freq[char] += 1
        else:
            freq[char] = 1
    
    sorted_chars = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    result = ""
    for char, count in sorted_chars:
        result += char * count
    
    return result

s = input()
print(frequencySort(s))
