Relative Ranks

array element is the score of nth athelete
The 1st place "Gold Medal".
The 2nd place "Silver Medal".
The 3rd place "Bronze Medal".
For the xth place athlete's rank is "x"
Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.

Input:
5
5 4 3 2 1
Output: Gold Medal Silver Medal Bronze Medal 4 5
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th]

Summary:
Sorting-based solution
Time complexity: O(n logn) because of sorting
Space complexity: O(n)
