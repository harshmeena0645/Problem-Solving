Longest Consecutive Sequence


nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. So length is 4.


nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9


nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3


Code-1:
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        nums = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for x in nums:
            if x - 1 not in nums:
                y = x + 1
                while y in nums:
                    y += 1
                best = max(best, y - x)
        return best
