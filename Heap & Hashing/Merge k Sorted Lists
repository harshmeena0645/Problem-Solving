Merge k Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 


import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        
    # For heapq to compare ListNode objects
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.val < other.val

class Solution(object):
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        heap = []
        
        # Step 1: Add first node of each list to the heap
        for l in lists:
            if l:
                heapq.heappush(heap, l)
        
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy
        
        # Step 2: Pop the smallest, add to result, push its next
        while heap:
            node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            curr.next = node
            curr = curr.next
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)
        
        return dummy.next
