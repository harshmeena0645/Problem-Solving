Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks

Input: capacity = [2,3,4,5], rocks = [1,2,4,4], additionalRocks = 2
Output: 3

Input: capacity = [10,2,2], rocks = [2,2,0], additionalRocks = 100
Output: 3

class Solution(object):
    def maximumBags(self, capacity, rocks, x):
        count = sorted(c - r for c,r in zip(capacity, rocks))[::-1]
        while count and x and count[-1] <= x:
            x -= count.pop()
        return len(rocks) - len(count)
