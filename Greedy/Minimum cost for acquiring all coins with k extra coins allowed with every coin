Minimum cost for acquiring all coins with k extra coins allowed with every coin

In addition, once you have paid for a coin, we can choose at most K more coins and can acquire those for free. The task is to find the minimum amount required to acquire all the N coins for a given value of K.

coin[] = {100, 20, 50, 10, 2, 5}, k = 3
Output : 7

coin[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50}, k = 3
Output : 3

 

import math
def minCost(coin, n, k): 
    coin.sort()
    coins_needed = math.ceil(1.0 * n //
                            (k + 1));
    ans = 0
    for i in range(coins_needed - 1 + 1): 
        ans += coin[i]
    return ans

coin = [8, 5, 3, 10, 
        2, 1, 15, 25]
n = len(coin)
k = 3
print(minCost(coin, n, k))

Output : 
3

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
